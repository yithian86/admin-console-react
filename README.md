# Admin Console React
A pretty basic FE project for an administration console of a web application.

The BE of this project is currently handled by a mock server in ExpressJS. I plan on doing an actual BE in Java Spring + some dumb DB thingy. Probably not. My current work-life balance is pretty messed up.


## How to install it
    npm i


## How to run it

## Current features:

### 'Languages' page
A page where the user can add and activate/deactivate the client web app languages.

### 'Manage translations' page (WIP):
A page where the user can add/edit/delete all the client web app labels. The page allows to see the translations in all available languages (even the inactive ones).
